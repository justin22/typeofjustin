Narayana Murthy (Infosys co-founder) said India's work culture needs to change and that youngsters should be prepared to work for 70 hours a week.
That created some spark in the industry.

I found myself backing that suggestion to some extent. If you look at my [career](/career), each job change required a lot of learning. Moving from Java to PHP, then to React
and Node.js, all those were possible with late-night learning, and building things.

Over the years, I did a lot of [side projects](/posts/side-project-endeavours) as well. None of this was made during my 9-5, but after that. Maybe 10-1 (in the night) and weekends.

Returning to what Narayana Murthy said, he might be talking about spending 70 hours for the company. And I have mixed thoughts about it.

Ultimately, everyone's career goal should be to learn, improve, and excel, both personally and professionally. If you think the company can help you reach your potential,
I'd definitely spend more time there, considering I'm fairly compensated well.

But if my corporate job is a dead end from a learning perspective after job hours will be spent on learning and practicing what I like and what I want.

In the long term, both approaches will work, since you are upskilling on a chronic basis.

Probably a super bright and intelligent person will need much fewer hours than I spent, but whatever works for you.

Have a long-term goal, work towards it, and spend your hours & days wisely.
