> This is a guide that helped me while working in engineering and product teams for B2B SaaS products. This post is highly opinionated and focused on SaaS product and engineering teams.

### 1. Understand your role

- Don’t just know your designation—understand your responsibilities.
- Be clear about expectations from your managers and peers, and strive to go above and beyond.

### 2. Obsess about the product

- Understand the industry; know what’s happening around you. Be aware of industry leaders.
- Understand your customers and their goals—what are they trying to achieve?
- What innovations are driving the industry? What are the new trends?
- Know what your competitors are doing.

### 3. Be open to learning new things

- Learn continuously. Don’t restrict your learning to your designation.
- Learn about product, marketing, industry, and design.
- You don’t have to be an expert in everything, but being aware of what’s happening in other fields will give you leverage.

### 4. Let go of your ego

- Be open-minded.
- Be willing to learn from everyone; talk to leaders and experts in their areas of work.
- Even if you think you’re the expert, remember there’s always someone better than you at something.

### 5. Talk to people from other departments; see how they work

- You will learn a thing or two from talking to others about work.
- Always be curious. Be inspired and inspire others.

### 6. Be a problem solver

- Don’t expect others to solve your problems for you. That won’t work in the long run.
- If you’re unable to arrive at a solution and want to discuss with someone else, make sure to share your findings and the solutions you’ve tried. That shows the effort you’ve put in before reaching out.

### 7. Don’t expect hand-holding or spoon-feeding

- Bring ideas to the table and take initiative.
- Make sure you grab every opportunity you get.

### 8. Be accountable

- If you commit to getting something done, get it done—without someone having to follow up.

### 9. Be kind to others

- Lend a helping hand when someone’s in need.
- Be nice to others, and there’s a good chance they’ll be nice to you.

### 10. Be a manager of one
