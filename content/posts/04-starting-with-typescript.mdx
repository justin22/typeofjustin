TypeScript gives you some superpowers when you work with JavaScript. 
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. Let's see what I mean by that with an example.

Let's say you have a variable called `name`.

```javascript
let name = 'JavaScript';
```

The data type of `name` is a string, but you can still assign values of other data types, `number` for instance. 
```javascript
let name = 'JavaScript';
console.log(typeof name) // string

name = 11;
console.log(typeof name) // number
```
This might feel like a superpower, but it could lead to confusion about valid values and inconsistencies. 

Typescript can help you to identify these at development time and show warnings if you try to assign different data types.

> The first time I started with Typescript, I got annoyed and ended up giving the type `any` to everything ü´£, which negates the power of TypeScript. But this time, I'm more focused on learning it üèÅ.

## Basic data types
Basic data types like string, number, and boolean can be used with TypeScript like below. 

```javascript
let name: string = 'JavaScript';
let version: number = 2015,
let isDeprecated: boolean = false;
```

Now, if you try the following thing, which is totally acceptable in JavaScript, 
```javascript
let name: string = 'JavaScript';
name = 123; // ‚õîÔ∏è
```
typescript will show you a warning `  Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'. `

## Arrays
If you have an array of numbers, you can use the following syntax to add type safety to them. 

```javascript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// If you try to add a string to the array, TypeScript will show you a warning, Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.  
```

TypeScript will warn you in other operations like push and contact. 

```javascript
const languages: string[] = ['JavaScript', 'Java'];
languages.push(2015) // ‚õîÔ∏è _Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'._
```

What do you do if your array can contain both numbers and strings?

```javascript
let mixedArray: Array< string| number> = [];
mixedArray  = ['1', 2, 3]
```

## Object

Consider the below object, 

```javascript
const language = {
  name: 'JavaScript',
  version: 2022
}

```
You can try to modify the value of version to a string, `language.version = '2022'` and JavaScript won't complain. To add type safety, you can create a type for your `language` object. 

```javascript
type Language = {
    name: string,
    version: number,
    isDeprecated: boolean
}

const language: Language = {
  name: 'JavaScript',
  version: 2022
}
```

The type safety of your object is assured, but we have an error now. 
`Property 'isDeprecated' is missing in type '{ name: string; version: number; }' but required in type 'Language'. `

In the `Language` type, `isDeprecated` is present, but that key is missing from the `language` object. Either you can add `isDeprecated` to the language, 

```javascript
const language: Language = {
  name: 'JavaScript',
  version: 2022,
  isDeprecated: false
}
```

or make `isDeprecated` optional using `?`

```javascript
type Language = {
    name: string,
    version: number,
    isDeprecated?: boolean
}
```

## Union type
At times, a variable could have 2 types of value. What we've seen so far, assigning only one data type to a variable, but with the help of union type, you can have the option to add multiple possible data types. 

```javascript
let fruit: string | null;
fruit = null;
fruit = 'apple';
```

TypeScript will allow you to have `null` or any kind of string value to the `fruit` variable. 

## Intersection type. 
With intersection type, you can build new types, by extending or combing your existing other types. See the example below. Both `User` and `Employee` can act as independent types, and we created a new type `UserEmployee` from both of them. 

```javascript
type User = {
    name: string,
    age: number
}

type Employee = {
    id: number
};

type UserEmployee = User & Employee;

const employee: UserEmployee = {
    name: 'Ben',
    age: 20,
    id: 102222
}
```

## Literal types 
If your variable can have only a defined set of values, literal types can be used to define those values. 

```javascript
let position: 'initial' | 'absolute' | 'fixed';

position = 'relative'; // ‚õîÔ∏è Type '" relative"' is not assignable to type '"initial" | "absolute" | "fixed"'
```

In the above example, `position` can have only values from `'initial', 'absolute', and 'fixed'`.


## Enums
Enums are useful when you have to define a set of constant values. 

```javascript
const enum Position {
    RELATIVE = 'relative',
    FIXED = 'fixed'
}

const divPositino = Position.RELATIVE;
```

Numeric values are also allowed inside enums 

```javascript
const enum Room {
    ONE = 1,
    TWO,
    THREE
}

const room = Room.ONE; // 1
```

One cool thing about numeric enum is that it has auto-incrementing behavior. In the `Room` enum, only `ONE` has the value. But subsequent keys will have auto-incremented values. 

```javascript
const room = Room.THREE; // = 3 üî•
```
---
Few benefits of using TypesScript, 
1. Avoid surprises by defining types, and catching errors at development time. 
2. When you work with a large team, setting a base expectation with types can be helpful and scalable. The initial learning curve can be justified with readable and predictable code. 
3. Autocomplete suggestions with IDE. If you have a variable of type `string`, your IDE can help you with possible operations you can do on that.
