When you work with Web applications, cookies are useful to store some pieces of information in the browser. 

Some common use cases for cookies are, 
1. Storing authentication tokens to authorize requests
2. Has the user closed a Subscribe to Newsletter modal?
3. User preference on dark theme vs light theme.
4. Used by most analytics tools such as Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Quora Pixel etc.

> ℹ️    Few of the above examples can be stored in local storage or session storage. 

Cookies can be set from both the server and the client. 

### Adding new data to the cookie

#### How to set cookies from the browser, using JavaScript code. 

```js
// adding new value to cookie
document.cookie = "theme=dark";

// reading cookie value
console.log(document.cookie) // 'theme=dark'
```

#### Setting cookie, from server
Similar to how your client code can create cookies, your server/API also can add new values to cookies. 
Let's say you are authenticating a user. User consent is sent to the server, the server validates the user, and sends back a Session Token to the client. 

The client will use this session to authorize further API requests. 

When your server responds to login requests, it can send a session token as a cookie in response headers. 

```js
Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
```

### Why would I use cookies over local storage or session storage? 
1. Cookies are sent to API Calls automatically (unless settings prohibit), so there's no reason to explicitly send them in case of authorization tokens and other necessary cookies. 
2. Unlike local storage and session storage, you have more control over cookies. You can set which pages can access them, how long should it live, and domain accessibility as well. 
3. Cookies provide security options which will be discussed in this post. 

### Lifetime of a cookie

It is possible to set a time limit for cookie expiry. 

```js
// setting expiry on client side
document.cookie = "theme=dark; expires=Mon, 09 Jan 2023 12:00:00 UTC";

// setting expiry from server response
Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9; Expires=Mon, 09 Jan 2023 12:00:00 UTC;
```
Cookies that have an expiry time are called permanent cookies.

Another type of expiry is when the browser session ends. These are called session cookies. 

### Cookie accessibility in domains

Similar to how you set an expiry time, you can set the Domain attribute as well. 
```js
Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9; Domain=typeofjust.in
```
If you set a domain value, your cookie will be accessible to the specified domain and its subdomains. If you do not specify a domain, a cookie will be only accessible to the host that sets the cookie. 

### Cookie path

The path attribute is helpful to determine what pages should access your cookie. 
```js
Set-Cookie: token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9; Path=/posts
```
With the above example, if I set a cookie on the `/posts` path, 
```js
🚫 cookie cannot be read from `/about`.
✅ cookie accessible from `/posts/1`
```

## Cookie Security

### SameSite

Cookie has a `SameSite` directive which can be used to control security. This directive is helpful to make sure your cookies are available only to the site that matches the domain which created it.

SameSite directive has 2 possible values. 
1. None
2. Lax (default)
3. Strict

##### SameSite=Lax
- Cookies will not be sent to cross-site subrequests, but are sent when the user is navigating to the origin site. If your site (Site A) has a backlink on another site (Site B), when the user clicks on the Site A link in Site B, Site A cookies will be sent with the request. 

##### SameSite=Strict
- Cookies will be sent only in a first-party context (host which set the cookie) and not sent with requests initiated by other sites. 

##### SameSite=none
- Sent in both first-party context and cross-site requests. 
- Secure is required to have this setting. `Secure; HttpOnly`
- HTTP can’t set cookies with Secure directives.

## Cookie limits in different browsers

- Firefox 108.0.2, > 30000* cookies
- Chromium: 109.0.5414.87, 180 cookies
- Safari Version 16.2, > 10000 *

```js 
* Firefox was getting pretty hung up with 30000 cookies.
* Unlike Firefox, Safari had problems at 10000
```
