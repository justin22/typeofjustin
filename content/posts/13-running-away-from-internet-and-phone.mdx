When I was in school, we had no computer at home. My dad had a basic phone which could make phone calls, send messages and play snake.
For any internet usage, I had to go to the nearest internet cafe. 

In college, I didn't have a personal computer/laptop until the second year (2012). Until then, the desktops placed inside the hostel library were the solution. 

**I was reaching out** to consume internet via internet cafe or hostel library. 

Now, the internet is with me, all time, everywhere I go. And I'm trying to get rid of it. 

In the last few years, I've noticed the internet (through phone and laptop) takes up a hefty amount of my time.

I would've never thought a situation like this would come. That I would get tired of watching YouTube videos, movies and scroll through internet. 

In the last 5-6 months, I've realized that getting rid of this addiction is not simple. It's more than willpower and determination. 

The phone is just a reach to the pocket away, with the notification sounds and the unlimited network data. 

I'm battling phone dependency with the phone itself. 

- Setting 30 minutes daily usage on YouTube
- Uninstalled Twitter from phone, logged out the browser session. Twitter is accessible through laptop only.
- I never bothered to try out Instagram and I'm glad I didn't. Got rid of Facebook ~8 years ago. 
- Prime Video, Netflix uninstalled from Phone. Keeping Hotstar only for English Premier League. Probably I should uninstall that too and watch on Laptop.
- Sleep mode activated from 11:00 PM to 6:45AM, making only Contacts, Messages and Phone apps accessible.

I wish getting rid of the smart phone itself was easier. But with the convenience of Google Maps, Google Pay and WhatsApp video calling, I don't see this
happening anytime soon. 

When I think about the restrictions I've put on the phone usage, makes me chuckle. Trying a full 180 in 10 years, from desperately trying to get online to
desperatly trying to get off of it. 

**From trying to consume internet to internet consuming you**, peddling my way back to the old days.
